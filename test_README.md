# Keyword Based Classification - Keyword based research

The code and the methods are widely inspired by **Text Classification Using Label Names Only: A Language Model Self-Training Approach**, published in EMNLP 2020.

## Requirements 

At least one GPU is needed to run the code and it needs enough memory to run the chosen Language Model.

Python 3.8 has been used, and Python 3.6 or above is strongly recommended because of possible package incompatibility issues with earlier versions.

To install the required packages, please type the following command:

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

```
